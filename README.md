## 📌 README Description (Recommended)

### 🧠 RAG-Based Chatbot (PDF Question Answering)

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot** that allows users to upload PDF documents and interactively ask questions based on the document content. The system combines **semantic search** using vector embeddings with **large language model generation** to provide accurate, context-aware responses.

The chatbot extracts text from uploaded PDFs, splits the content into meaningful chunks, generates embeddings using **HuggingFace Sentence Transformers**, stores them in a **FAISS vector database**, and retrieves the most relevant information to answer user queries using **Google Gemini**.

This application is built with **Streamlit** for an intuitive user interface and demonstrates a practical end-to-end RAG pipeline suitable for document analysis, knowledge assistants, and research applications.
